# generate-agv-description

Generate a properly formatted `description.adoc` file for AgnosticV catalog entries that appears in the Red Hat Demo Platform UI.

## Quick Start

**Easiest way to use:**

1. Navigate to your Showroom guide directory or AgnosticV catalog directory
2. Run: `/generate-agv-description`
3. Provide path to your Showroom guide (or press Enter if in current directory)
4. Review auto-extracted information and adjust as needed
5. Preview and confirm
6. Done! Optionally commit to git

**Even faster:** If already in your Showroom repo:
```bash
cd ~/work/code/showroom_my_lab
/generate-agv-description
# Just press Enter when asked for path (uses current directory)
```

## What This Skill Does

Interactively gathers information about your lab/demo and generates a complete `description.adoc` file following RHDP catalog standards.

**Smart features:**
- Reads your Showroom guide to auto-extract modules, technologies, and structure
- Pulls author info from git config
- Detects AgnosticV catalog paths automatically
- Suggests content based on guide analysis
- Validates output before writing
- Offers to commit changes and update catalog files

## Information Gathered

This skill will ask you for:

0. **Showroom Location** (FIRST - makes everything else easier!)
   - Path to your Showroom guide directory
   - Auto-extracts module structure, technologies, and agenda
   - Optional: can skip if no guide yet

1. **Brief Overview**
   - What is this thing showing? (2-3 sentences)
   - What is the intended use?
   - **Smart feature**: If guide provided, suggests overview from content

2. **Warnings** (optional)
   - Any important notices (e.g., GPU availability, resource requirements)
   - These appear after the overview on the UI tile
   - **Smart feature**: Checks guide for prerequisites automatically

3. **Guide Link**
   - Link to rendered Showroom guide
   - Or repository/document URL if no Showroom exists
   - **Smart feature**: Tries to infer Showroom URL from repo path

4. **Featured Technology and Products**
   - Key products/technologies (not everything, just what matters)
   - Version numbers
   - Examples: OpenShift 4.17, Ansible Automation Platform 2.5, etc.
   - **Smart feature**: Suggests technologies found in guide content

5. **Detailed Overview/Agenda** (optional)
   - Detailed breakdown of what learners will do
   - Module-by-module or step-by-step agenda
   - **Smart feature**: Auto-generates from module titles if guide provided

6. **Authors and Contact**
   - Lab/Demo author name(s) - **defaults from git config**
   - Slack channel for questions - **defaults to #forum-rhdp-content**
   - Author's Slack handle for tagging

## Output

Generates a complete `description.adoc` file in AsciiDoc format ready to commit to your AgnosticV catalog entry.

## Structure

The generated `description.adoc` follows this structure:

1. **Brief overview** (2-3 sentences)
   - What is this thing showing?
   - What is the intended use?

2. **Warnings** (optional)
   - These come after the brief overview so they don't waste space on the UI tile
   - For example, a message about GPU availability would go here

3. **Link to rendered version of guide**
   - This should almost always be a link to the rendered Showroom
   - If no Showroom, a link to the repo or document being used

4. **Featured Technology and Products**
   - Do not list every product, list the ones that matter
   - Include versions and maintain this list
   - Use common sense for how much to include

5. **Detailed overview/agenda** (optional)
   - You can write this yourself, or
   - Auto-generated by analyzing your Showroom content

6. **Lab/Demo authors and contact information**
   - This isn't for support with RHDP, this is for questions or issues about the content
   - Format: "Go to Slack and tag {author} in this channel"

## Execution

When this skill runs, gather the following information interactively:

### Step 0: Locate Showroom Content (FIRST)

**CRITICAL:** Before asking any questions, detect current directory first:

1. **Auto-detect current directory:**
   - Check if current directory contains `antora.yml` and `content/modules/` - this is a Showroom repo!
   - If detected, suggest: "I detected a Showroom guide in the current directory. Use this? (yes/other path/skip)"

2. **If not auto-detected, ask:**
   - "Where is your Showroom guide located?"
   - Prompt: "Path to Showroom guide (press Enter to skip, or provide path like /Users/psrivast/work/code/showroom_my_lab)"
   - If user provides a path, read the guide files to extract information automatically
   - If user says "no guide yet" or presses Enter, proceed with manual entry

If a Showroom path is provided:

1. **Read the guide structure:**
   - Look for `content/modules/*.adoc` files or `content/modules/ROOT/pages/*.adoc`
   - Read `antora.yml` or `site.yml` for title and metadata
   - Extract module titles from each module file

2. **Extract key information:**
   - Module titles (for agenda)
   - Technologies mentioned in the guide
   - Any warnings or prerequisites mentioned
   - Guide structure (lab vs demo)

3. **Use extracted info to pre-populate suggestions:**
   - Show the user what you found
   - Offer to use this as a starting point
   - Allow user to edit/override

### Step 1: Basic Information

Ask the user:
- **What is this lab/demo about?** (2-3 sentence overview)
  - If guide was read, suggest an overview based on content
  - User can accept, edit, or provide their own
- **What is the intended use?** (self-paced learning, workshop, demo, sales enablement, etc.)
- **Are there any warnings or special requirements?** (optional - GPU needs, resource limits, beta features, etc.)
  - If guide was read, check for any prerequisites mentioned

### Step 2: Guide and Technology

Ask the user:
- **What is the link to the rendered Showroom guide?** (or repo/doc URL if no Showroom)
  - If guide was read from a repo, try to infer the Showroom URL pattern
  - Common patterns: `https://rhpds.github.io/showroom-{repo-name}`
- **What are the featured technologies and products?** (with versions)
  - If guide was read, suggest technologies found in the content
  - Prompt: "List the key products with versions, e.g., 'OpenShift 4.17, AAP 2.5, PostgreSQL 16'"

### Step 3: Detailed Content (Optional)

Ask the user:
- **Would you like to include a detailed overview/agenda?**
  - If guide was read, automatically generate agenda from module titles
  - Show the generated agenda and ask if they want to use/edit it
  - If no guide: "Provide the module-by-module or detailed agenda content"
  - If user declines: Skip this section

### Step 4: Authors and Contact

**Smart defaults:** Extract from git config before asking:

1. Run `git config user.name` to get author name
2. Suggest this as default: "Author: [Name from git] (press Enter to accept or type to override)"
3. Ask for Slack channel (default: #forum-rhdp-content)
4. Ask for Slack handle (try to infer from git email or ask)

### Step 5: Determine Output Location

**Smart detection:**

1. Check if currently in an AgnosticV catalog directory structure
   - Look for pattern: `*/agnosticv/*/catalog_items/*/description.adoc`
2. If in AgnosticV structure, suggest: `./description.adoc`
3. If in Showroom repo, suggest: `./description.adoc` or ask for AgV catalog path
4. Otherwise ask: "Where should I save description.adoc?"
5. Check if file exists and ask to overwrite if needed

### Step 6: Generate description.adoc

Using the gathered information, generate a `description.adoc` file with this structure:

```asciidoc
[Brief overview - 2-3 sentences about what this shows and intended use]

[WARNING]
====
[Warning text if provided]
====

link:[Guide URL][Access the rendered lab guide^]

== Featured Technology and Products

* [Product 1] [Version]
* [Product 2] [Version]
* [Product 3] [Version]

== What You Will Learn

[Detailed agenda/overview content if provided]

== Authors and Contact

*Authors:* [Author names]

For questions or issues with this content, please reach out in the [Slack channel] Slack channel and tag [author handle].

NOTE: This is for content questions only. For RHDP platform support, use #forum-rhdp.
```

**Formatting Rules:**
- Brief overview: NO heading, just 2-3 sentences at the top
- Warnings: Use AsciiDoc `[WARNING]` block with `====` delimiters
- Guide link: Use `link:url[Link Text^]` format (^ opens in new tab)
- Technology list: Level 2 heading (`==`) with bullet points
- Detailed overview: Level 2 heading (`==`) with content
- Authors: Level 2 heading (`==`) with formatted contact info

### Step 7: Preview and Confirm

Before writing the file:

1. **Show a preview** of the generated `description.adoc`
2. Ask: "Does this look good? (yes/edit/cancel)"
   - **yes**: Write the file and complete
   - **edit**: Ask what to change and regenerate
   - **cancel**: Exit without writing

### Step 8: Write and Verify

1. Write the file to the determined location
2. Confirm: "✓ Created description.adoc at [path]"
3. Validate the AsciiDoc syntax (check for common issues)
4. Offer next steps:
   - "Would you like me to commit this to git?"
   - "Should I also update the AgnosticV common.yaml file?"

### Step 9: Optional Follow-up Actions

If user requests:

- **Git commit**: Create commit with message "Add/update catalog description for [lab name]"
- **Update common.yaml**: Add or update catalog entry if in AgnosticV repo
- **Generate README**: Create a README.md version for GitHub display

## Best Practices

1. **Keep the overview concise** - The first 2-3 sentences appear on the catalog tile
2. **List only key products** - Don't overwhelm with every dependency
3. **Include version numbers** - Helps users know if content is current
4. **Make warnings visible** - Put important requirements right after overview
5. **Always link to Showroom** - Rendered guides are better than raw repos
6. **Make contact clear** - Slack channel + author tag is the preferred pattern

---

## Tips for Best Results

**For maximum automation:**
- Run the skill from your Showroom guide directory
- Ensure your Showroom modules have clear titles
- Have your git config set up (`git config user.name`)

**Common Showroom patterns recognized:**
- `content/modules/*.adoc` - Standard Antora structure
- `content/modules/ROOT/pages/*.adoc` - Showroom structure
- Module title format: `= Module Title` (first line of module file)
- Prerequisites in index or first module

**If auto-detection isn't working:**
- Verify `antora.yml` or `site.yml` exists in your Showroom root
- Check that modules are in `content/modules/` directory
- Provide the full absolute path when asked

**After generation:**
- Review the preview carefully before writing
- The description appears on RHDP catalog tiles, so clarity matters
- Test the Showroom link to ensure it's correct

## Integration with Other Skills

**Typical workflow**:
1. `/create-lab` or `/create-demo` - Create Showroom content first
2. `/verify-content` - Verify quality
3. `/generate-agv-description` - Generate catalog description ← **YOU ARE HERE**
4. Manual: Copy to AgV catalog directory (if not already there)
5. Manual: Test catalog in RHDP Integration
6. Manual: Create PR to AgnosticV repository
