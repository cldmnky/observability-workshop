== Timing and schedule

=== Full workshop (4 hours)

* **Module 1**: User workload monitoring (60 minutes)
* **Module 2**: Logging with LokiStack (60 minutes)
* **Module 3**: Distributed tracing (60 minutes)
* **Module 4**: OpenTelemetry integration (60 minutes)

=== Abbreviated workshop (2 hours)

* **Module 1**: User workload monitoring (30 minutes)
* **Module 2**: Logging basics (30 minutes)
* **Module 3**: Distributed tracing overview (30 minutes)
* **Module 4**: OpenTelemetry introduction (30 minutes)

== Technical requirements

=== Software versions

* Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.21
* Cluster Observability Operator 1.3.1
* Red Hat OpenShift Logging 6.4
* Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry 0.140.0-2
* Tempo Operator 0.19.0-3
* Network Observability Operator 1.10.1

=== Environment access

Participants need access to:

* Red Hat OpenShift cluster (provided during workshop)
* Namespace with admin privileges
* OpenShift CLI (oc) - pre-configured in lab terminal
* Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
* Pre-deployed observability stack via GitOps

=== Pre-configured components

The following components are already deployed and configured in your lab environment:

* **User Workload Monitoring**: Prometheus, Thanos, Alertmanager
* **Logging**: LokiStack with storage configured
* **Distributed Tracing**: Tempo with OpenShift integration
* **OpenTelemetry**: Operator and collector deployed
* **Sample Application**: Microservices demo application for testing

=== Network requirements

* Internet connectivity for accessing OpenShift console
* Access to OpenShift cluster API
* Browser access to monitoring dashboards

== Environment setup

=== Pre-workshop checklist

□ **OpenShift cluster access confirmed** - Test login credentials
□ **Terminal access verified** - Confirm oc CLI works
□ **Browser access tested** - Open OpenShift console
□ **Sample application running** - Verify demo app is deployed
□ **GitOps sync confirmed** - Check ArgoCD application status

=== Setup validation

Participants should run these commands to verify setup:

[source,bash]
----
# Verify OpenShift CLI
oc version

# Test cluster connectivity
oc whoami

# Check current project
oc project

# Verify observability stack
oc get pods -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring
oc get pods -n openshift-logging
oc get pods -n openshift-tempo-operator
----

== Troubleshooting guide

=== Common setup issues

**Problem**: "oc command not found"
→ **Solution**: The oc CLI should be pre-installed in the lab terminal. If missing, refresh your browser.

**Problem**: "Permission denied" errors
→ **Solution**: Verify you're using the correct namespace. Check with `oc project` and switch if needed using `oc project <namespace-name>`.

**Problem**: "Unable to connect to OpenShift console"
→ **Solution**: Verify you're using the correct console URL from the lab interface: {openshift_cluster_console_url}

**Problem**: "Prometheus metrics not appearing"
→ **Solution**: Check ServiceMonitor configuration and verify pods are running: `oc get servicemonitor`

**Problem**: "Logs not visible in Loki"
→ **Solution**: Verify ClusterLogForwarder is configured: `oc get clusterlogforwarder -n openshift-logging`

=== During workshop support

* Use the lab terminal for all command line operations
* Console access is available via {openshift_console_url}
* All credentials are provided in the lab interface
* Sample applications are pre-deployed for testing
