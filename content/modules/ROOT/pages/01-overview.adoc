== Your role and mission

You are implementing observability for cloud native applications running on OpenShift. Your organization needs to reduce mean time to resolution for production issues and improve overall application reliability.

Current monitoring gaps increase troubleshooting time for production incidents. The organization requires comprehensive visibility into application health and performance.

**Your assignment**: Implement comprehensive observability for microservices applications running on OpenShift to enable faster issue detection and resolution.

**The objective**: Demonstrate how metrics, logs, and traces work together to provide complete visibility into application behavior and performance.

== Success criteria for your mission

By the end of this workshop, you'll have practical observability skills to address operational challenges:

* Configure user workload monitoring with custom metrics and alerts → **proactively detect application issues before they impact users**
* Implement centralized logging with LokiStack for efficient log analysis → **reduce time spent searching through distributed logs**
* Set up distributed tracing to visualize request flows across microservices → **quickly identify performance bottlenecks**
* Instrument applications with OpenTelemetry for unified telemetry collection → **standardize observability across all services**
* Correlate signals (metrics, logs, traces) to diagnose complex issues → **reduce mean time to resolution through unified signal analysis**

**Technical outcome**: You'll have hands-on experience implementing a production-ready observability stack on OpenShift.

**Business benefit**: Proven approach to improving application reliability and reducing operational overhead through comprehensive observability.

== Target audience

This workshop is designed for:

* Application developers who want to improve application reliability
* Platform engineers implementing observability solutions
* SREs and DevOps practitioners responsible for production systems
* Technical professionals evaluating OpenShift observability capabilities

== What you need to succeed

You should have:

* Basic understanding of OpenShift and Kubernetes concepts
* Experience with containerized applications and microservices
* Familiarity with command line tools and YAML configuration
* Basic knowledge of monitoring and logging concepts
* Access to a computer with internet connectivity

== Operational challenges

**The situation**: Your organization runs a complex microservices application on OpenShift but lacks comprehensive observability, leading to extended troubleshooting times and production incidents.

**Current challenges**:

* **Limited visibility**: Only basic infrastructure monitoring exists → cannot see application-level health or business metrics
* **Log fragmentation**: Logs scattered across multiple pods and namespaces → troubleshooting requires manual log collection and correlation
* **No distributed tracing**: Difficult to understand request flows across 12+ microservices → performance issues take hours to diagnose
* **Manual correlation**: When issues occur, teams manually piece together metrics and logs → mean time to resolution averages 2-4 hours
* **Reactive monitoring**: No custom alerts for business-critical metrics → issues discovered by users first

**The opportunity**: Implementing comprehensive observability with OpenShift's monitoring stack, LokiStack logging, distributed tracing, and OpenTelemetry instrumentation will improve the ability to maintain reliable applications.

**Technical goal**: Move from reactive firefighting to proactive monitoring. Complete visibility into application behavior enables early issue detection and faster resolution.

== Expected outcomes

When comprehensive observability is implemented, here are the expected improvements:

**Immediate improvements**:

* **Faster troubleshooting**: Reduce mean time to resolution from 2-4 hours to 15-30 minutes through centralized observability and correlation
* **Proactive alerts**: Custom metrics and alerts detect issues before user impact → shift from reactive to proactive operations
* **Unified logging**: Centralized log analysis with LokiStack → troubleshoot issues without SSH access to individual pods
* **Request tracing**: Visualize complete request flows → identify bottlenecks in seconds instead of hours

**Strategic benefits**:

* **Improved reliability**: Better visibility leads to higher application uptime and faster incident resolution
* **Reduced operational costs**: Less time spent troubleshooting → teams can focus on feature development
* **Performance optimization**: Data-driven insights enable targeted improvements → better resource utilization
* **Standardized instrumentation**: OpenTelemetry provides consistent observability across all services → easier onboarding and maintenance

**Success metric**: Measurable reduction in mean time to detection and mean time to resolution for production incidents, with comprehensive visibility into application health.

== Common questions

**"Do I need to instrument every microservice individually?"**
→ Yes, but Module 4 shows how OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation reduces the effort significantly

**"What's the difference between metrics, logs, and traces?"**
→ Module 1 explains the 3 pillars of observability and when to use each signal type

**"Can I use my existing Prometheus queries?"**
→ Yes. OpenShift user workload monitoring uses Prometheus, so existing queries work unchanged

**"How much storage does logging and tracing require?"**
→ Module 2 covers LokiStack storage configuration and Module 3 discusses trace sampling strategies

**"Is this approach suitable for production?"**
→ Yes. This workshop uses the same observability stack that Red Hat supports for production OpenShift environments
