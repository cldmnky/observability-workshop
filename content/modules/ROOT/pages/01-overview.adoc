== Your role and mission

You're a senior developer at Red Hat Observability Inc., and you've been assigned to improve the reliability and troubleshooting capabilities for the company's cloud-native applications.

Red Hat Observability Inc. needs to reduce mean time to resolution for production issues and improve overall application reliability. Your manager has explained: "We're spending too much time troubleshooting production incidents, and our current monitoring gaps are costing us valuable development time and customer satisfaction."

**Your assignment**: Implement comprehensive observability for the company's microservices applications running on OpenShift to enable faster issue detection and resolution.

**The objective**: Demonstrate how metrics, logs, and traces work together to provide complete visibility into application behavior and performance.

== Success criteria for your mission

By the end of this workshop, you'll have practical observability skills to address Red Hat Observability Inc.'s operational challenges:

* Configure user workload monitoring with custom metrics and alerts → **proactively detect application issues before they impact users**
* Implement centralized logging with LokiStack for efficient log analysis → **reduce time spent searching through distributed logs**
* Set up distributed tracing to visualize request flows across microservices → **quickly identify performance bottlenecks**
* Instrument applications with OpenTelemetry for unified telemetry collection → **standardize observability across all services**
* Correlate signals (metrics, logs, traces) to diagnose complex issues → **dramatically reduce mean time to resolution**

**Technical outcome**: You'll have hands-on experience implementing a production-ready observability stack on OpenShift.

**Business benefit**: Proven approach to improving application reliability and reducing operational overhead through comprehensive observability.

== Target audience

This workshop is designed for:

* Application developers who want to improve application reliability
* Platform engineers implementing observability solutions
* SREs and DevOps practitioners responsible for production systems
* Technical professionals evaluating OpenShift observability capabilities

== What you need to succeed

You should have:

* Basic understanding of OpenShift and Kubernetes concepts
* Experience with containerized applications and microservices
* Familiarity with command line tools and YAML configuration
* Basic knowledge of monitoring and logging concepts
* Access to a computer with internet connectivity

== Red Hat Observability Inc.'s operational challenges

**The situation**: Red Hat Observability Inc. runs a complex microservices application on OpenShift, but lacks comprehensive observability, leading to extended troubleshooting times and production incidents.

**Current challenges** (operational pain points):

* **Limited visibility**: Only basic infrastructure monitoring exists → cannot see application-level health or business metrics
* **Log fragmentation**: Logs scattered across multiple pods and namespaces → troubleshooting requires manual log collection and correlation
* **No distributed tracing**: Difficult to understand request flows across 12+ microservices → performance issues take hours to diagnose
* **Manual correlation**: When issues occur, teams manually piece together metrics and logs → mean time to resolution averages 2-4 hours
* **Reactive monitoring**: No custom alerts for business-critical metrics → issues discovered by customers first

**The opportunity**: Implementing comprehensive observability with OpenShift's monitoring stack, LokiStack logging, distributed tracing, and OpenTelemetry instrumentation will dramatically improve the team's ability to maintain reliable applications.

**Technical perspective**: "We need to move from reactive firefighting to proactive monitoring. Complete visibility into our application behavior will let us catch issues early and resolve them quickly."

== Your vision of success

When comprehensive observability is implemented at Red Hat Observability Inc., here's the expected improvements:

**Immediate improvements** (short-term):

* **Faster troubleshooting**: Reduce mean time to resolution from 2-4 hours to 15-30 minutes → improve customer satisfaction and reduce operational stress
* **Proactive alerts**: Custom metrics and alerts catch issues before customer impact → shift from reactive to proactive operations
* **Unified logging**: Centralized log analysis with LokiStack → troubleshoot issues without SSH access to individual pods
* **Request tracing**: Visualize complete request flows → identify bottlenecks in seconds instead of hours

**Strategic benefits** (longer-term):

* **Improved reliability**: Better visibility leads to higher application uptime → increased customer confidence
* **Reduced operational costs**: Less time spent troubleshooting → teams can focus on feature development
* **Performance optimization**: Data-driven insights enable targeted improvements → better resource utilization
* **Standardized instrumentation**: OpenTelemetry provides consistent observability across all services → easier onboarding and maintenance

**Success metric**: Measurable reduction in mean time to detection and mean time to resolution for production incidents, with comprehensive visibility into application health.

== Common questions

**"Do I need to instrument every microservice individually?"**
→ Yes, but Module 4 shows how OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation reduces the effort significantly

**"What's the difference between metrics, logs, and traces?"**
→ Module 1 explains the 3 pillars of observability and when to use each signal type

**"Can I use my existing Prometheus queries?"**
→ Yes. OpenShift user workload monitoring uses Prometheus, so existing queries work unchanged

**"How much storage does logging and tracing require?"**
→ Module 2 covers LokiStack storage configuration and Module 3 discusses trace sampling strategies

**"Is this approach suitable for production?"**
→ Yes. This workshop uses the same observability stack that Red Hat supports for production OpenShift environments
