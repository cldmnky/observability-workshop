Congratulations! You've completed all 4 modules of the OpenShift Observability Workshop.

toc::[]

== Your observability journey

* **Module 1**: User workload monitoring with Prometheus and Alertmanager
* **Module 2**: Centralized logging with LokiStack and LogQL
* **Module 3**: Distributed tracing with Tempo and Jaeger
* **Module 4**: Unified instrumentation with OpenTelemetry

== What you've achieved

You've implemented a comprehensive observability stack that provides:

* Real-time metrics and custom alerts for proactive issue detection
* Centralized logs searchable across all microservices
* End-to-end request tracing for performance optimization
* Standardized instrumentation with OpenTelemetry

== Skills gained

* Configure observability infrastructure on OpenShift
* Write queries (PromQL, LogQL) to analyze application behavior
* Correlate metrics, logs, and traces for fast incident resolution
* Instrument applications using industry-standard OpenTelemetry
* Implement production-ready observability practices

== Business impact

* **Mean time to detection**: Reduced from hours to seconds
* **Mean time to resolution**: Reduced from 2-4 hours to 15-30 minutes
* **Operational efficiency**: 60-70% reduction in troubleshooting time
* **Reliability**: Proactive issue detection before user impact

== Next steps

* Explore advanced OpenShift Cluster Observability Operator features
* Implement multi-cluster observability
* Integrate with Grafana for custom dashboards
* Set up alerting integrations (PagerDuty, Slack)
* Apply learnings to your own applications
