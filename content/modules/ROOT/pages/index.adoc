= OpenShift Observability Workshop

Welcome to the OpenShift Observability Workshop!

== What you'll learn

In this workshop, you will:

* Configure and use user workload monitoring with Prometheus and Alertmanager for application health tracking
* Implement logging with LokiStack for troubleshooting and performance analysis
* Set up distributed tracing to understand microservices interactions and identify bottlenecks
* Instrument applications using Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry for comprehensive observability
* Analyze and correlate metrics, logs, and traces for effective problem resolution

== Who this is for

This workshop is designed for developers who want to implement comprehensive observability for applications running on OpenShift.

**Experience level**: Intermediate

== Prerequisites

Before starting this workshop, you should have:

* Basic understanding of OpenShift and Kubernetes concepts
* Familiarity with containerized applications and microservices
* Experience with command line tools and YAML configuration
* Basic knowledge of monitoring and logging concepts

== Workshop environment

This workshop provides a fully configured OpenShift 4.21 multi-node cluster with the observability stack pre-deployed using GitOps.

You will have access to:

* OpenShift cluster: {openshift_cluster_console_url}
* Username: {openshift_cluster_admin_username}
* Password: {openshift_cluster_admin_password}

NOTE: All environment details and credentials are available in the lab interface. The observability stack (Prometheus, Loki, Tempo, OpenTelemetry Operator) is already configured and ready for you to use.

== Estimated time

This workshop will take approximately **4 hours** to complete.
