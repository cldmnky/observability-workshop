# This directory is populated at container build time by the Containerfile.
# The builder copies the relevant source files here so they are embedded
# into the frontend binary via //go:embed code.
#
# Local builds (go build ./frontend) work with this sparse directory –
# the /api/code endpoint will return an empty listing, which is expected.
